Here is some complex backstory lore for ahum 1 and 2

The story begins about one million years in our future. The human race has expanded using ftl tech to have taken over almost half the Milky Way. However, they are tired and an eccentric quadrillionaire whose name shall not be mentioned has an idea.
A mega resort; the largest structure ever built, around a middle aged quasi star found on the other end of a wormhole in an alternate reality with an extremely young universe.

With subsidies from several organizations and alien empires, he begins work on his masterpiece. The attempt to stabilize the quasi star by converting its inner black hole unfortunately fails because they gave the starship a little too much intelligence. From this artificial intelligence mishap is birthed Romulus, who immediately seizes automatic probes and uses them across the young universe to absorb gas and keep the quasi star active and stable, whilst attempting to open new wormholes to the humans’ universe.

Terrified, the Scion Project is shut it down and the original wormhole leading to a high orbit of the quasi-star is heavily guarded. Unfortunately, the hastily designed militia with only a few gun ships was not prepared for a photon beam of gamma ray energy levels reaching 33% that of a quasi-star. Romulus uses this beam of pure annihilation to instantaneously destroy every ship and the sentients within. 
Inadvertently, Romulus had just invented gamma warfare, in which two sides fire gamma ray bursts from concentrated energy from Dyson spheres at one another or through wormholes.

The wormhole in the humans dimension is now designated as “Quirinus” and is known to have an apparatus surrounding it that allows it to accelerate to ftl speeds to absorb colony ships and bring them to Romulus’s system, to serve in a massive system-wide zoo of sorts.
Humans then decide that instead of utilizing this monster they had to destroy it. Developing an incredibly adaptable and powerful bio weapon, nicknamed after Enrico Fermi for its incredible danger of it ever turned against its masters. But they were desperate and so many had already been lost.
Fifty years after Fermi begins growing, a small derelict ship is swallowed by Quirinus, and so the kerbals are introduced to the Romulus system. Perhaps they will be courageous (or stupid) enough to work with the factions at play to destroy Romulus.

Luckily, by working closely with fermi the kerbals succeed! But alas, a quasi star collapsing is not a nice event. And since Romulus had absorbed another nearby quasi star dubbed “Remus”, the dual explosion was absurdly powerful that it was felt by higher order lifeforms, who may not be so happy with the destruction of such a relay
But alas, Romulus would not be killed so easily. Two opposing sides lay dormant in Ahum 1, the young binary system being a hotspot for rogue pieces of Romulus and mutated shards of fermi. If someone was stupid enough to wake either, the massive resultant war on the scale of multiple galaxies would be nearly impossible to survive.

Now for some pretty screenshots!

I hope you all enjoy Ahum 2, and may Romulus have mercy on you!
